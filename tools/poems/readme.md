This directory contains an experimental execution environment for
POETS applications. It is not a simulator, as the intent was to
see how well a standard multi-core can execute POETS apps, rather
than to verify behaviour of an app.

The simulator is structured in such a way that any XML app could
be compiled as input, but general input is not supported due to
time restrictions.
