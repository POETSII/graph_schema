This test-case comes from Orchestrator_examples
https://github.com/POETSII/Orchestrator_examples/blob/development/ping_pong_timer.xml
Latest commit 3a3658b  
- Fixes:
    - Added xmlns so the parser knows it is v4 xml
    - Moved initialiser into graph instances: uint8_t maxLaps = 9;  /* Zero-based indexing */
    - Added braces around initialisers for device instance properties
    - RTS is made non-sticky: devices have to consistently say they want to send
    - Supervisor calls stop_application
    
    A series of five devices connected in a directional ring. When a device
receives a message, it sends two messages: one to the next normal device in the
ring, and one to its supervisor device.
A message holds the "lap" it's on. Device zero increments the lap counter of a
message on receipt, and stops the packet after its tenth lap. Device zero is
also responsible for sending the initial packet.
The supervisor device records all received packets (including their sender and
the lap), and writes "1" to the output file ("ring_test_output") once the
packet has completed ten laps. If an inappropriate packet is received, the
supervisor device writes "0", and ignores all new packets.
