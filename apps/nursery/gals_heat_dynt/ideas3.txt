Assume a poisson style problem, with coefficient a.
Let's assume that a varies temporally in some way.

Assume each cell has an intrinsic simulation time t,
and a coefficient a(t). From that we can determine
the current time-step dt(t), and want to move forwards
to dt(t)+t.

To do that we need to know x(t,i) for all neighbours i \in N.

Assume each event contains the following information:
- tN : Time of next event
- tC : Time of this event
- xC : Value at this event
- dC : dx/dt at this event
