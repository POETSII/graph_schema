Every cell tracks a time bracket for each cell:
- bt[i] < et[i] <= ft[i] - beginning and end and future time of bracket for neighbour i
- bv[i],ev[i],fv[i] - beginning and end and future values for bracket for neighbour i

The current time of a cell is given by t, and its time step by dt.

A cell can advance from t to t' = t+dt if for all neighbours i:
- bt[i] < t    (always holds)
- t <= et[i]   (may not hold if we haven't received updated)

After advancing, each neighbour is updated as:
- if t' <=et[i], then bracket stays the same
- if t' > et[i], then bt'=et, et'=ft, and ft is unchanged


So the possible orderings are:
- bt[i] < t <= et[i] <= ft[i]   ready to update based on i
- bt[i] < et[i] = ft[i] < t    blocked on neighbour i

What isn't possible is:
- bt[i] < et[i] < t <= ft[i]    impossible, we remove this situation when receiving the update
