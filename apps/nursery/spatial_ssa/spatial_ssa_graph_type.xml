	A stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) with cells distributed
	on a grid. The intention is that cells that are doing nothing
	can jump forwards with large time-steps, whereas those with lots
	of molecules take small steps.

        Each cell has N neighbours, and at the outset does not know the
        times of its neighbours. So first there is an exchange period, where
	all that happens is sharing of times. Eventually the neighbour with
	the earliest time will know it is the earliest, perform its reaction,
	and broadcast its new reaction time.

        Events to neighbours may purely contain updates to next reaction time,
        or they may also contain a molecule that is being delivered. If an
	event arrives with a molecule, then it could change the next event
	time, including making it happen sooner than expected or later. However,
	the next time will never be updated to be before the time of arrival of
	the event due to the waiting/memory-less property.

        The problem comes that the arrival of an event t_e could cause a cell
        to choose a time t_n' where t_n > t_n' > t_e. This means that everyone
	elses idea of when the cell will next fire is now wrong. Potentially
	this is quite bad, as we could have had t_n = \infty and t_n' finite
	(for example if there were previously no molecules in the cell and
	now there is one).

        We could try to organise some safety bounds around this, by choosing
        t_n - eps where eps somehow gives us enough safety, but a guaranteed
	safety factor seems very difficult to calculate.

        We can take the notion of "critical" cells, which have a small
        number of molecules, and potentially switch between tau-leaping
	(everyone jumps forwards) and strict lock-step on the critical
	parts.

        One possibility is some kind of agreed neighbourhood lock-step,
        where the neighbourhood shares a (t,tau) pair. Each cell then
	steps forwards by the smallest tau in the neighbourhood?
