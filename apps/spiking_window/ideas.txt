Each neuron x has nIn(x) inputs and nOut(x) outputs.

Time is discretised into integers.

There is a delay between each neuron, which is
a positive integer.

Each neuron is currently at time t, and maintains
a window of accumulated pulses for h steps into
the future.

When a neuron fires at time t, it sends a message
to all connected neurons, and they will accumulate
into {t+d}, where d is the delay of that connection.

Assumption: lets's assume that messages from one
device to another will never be re-ordered against
each other.

When a neuron fires, it has to send the time it
fired, so the receiver knows that it will receive
any stimulus for periods before that of the message.
But if the neuron doesn't fire, the receiver doesn't
know that the stimulus is empty for that time slot.

Let's update the message format:
- t : the time this message was sent
- dt : the time since the last message
- fire : whether or not the message represents a spike

We can then send (t,8,1) to indicate that there was
a firing at t, but no firings for t-7..t-1.. Or
we could send (t,12,0) to indicate that there were
no firings throughout t-11..t.

Let's augment the window to be a list of pairs,
(n_i,a_i), where a_i is the accumulation for t+i,
and n is the number of values seen for t+i. If
we have n_1=nIn(x), then neuron x can move forwards
to t+1. 

Hypothesis: there is some kind of critical value alpha
where as long as we broadcast the "nothing happened"
message every alpha steps, then the whole thing can
make progress and not deadlock.

Proof: well, we can just choose alpha=1. This means
that we broadcast everything. Bit useless though.
