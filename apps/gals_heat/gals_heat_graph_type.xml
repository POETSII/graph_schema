    <!-- Locally synchronous heat.
	 Each cell i has a time t, and all cells start at t=0.
	 Initially each cell knows its own state, but not its
	 neighbours, so all cells want to broadcast their state and move to t=1.
	 However, there is no ordering on the broadcasts, so the
	 order they achieve it in is going to be random.

         As the messages fly we have a number of situations:
         - t=0, no messages received    : wants to send t=0
	 - t=0, some messages received  : wants to send t=0
	 - t=0, all messages received   : wants to send t=1 (could also send t=2, but has to do t=1 first)
	 - t=1, no messaged received    : blocked
	 - t=1, some messages received  : blocked
	 - t=1, all messages recieved   : wants to send t=2

         In order to progress to t=2 (i.e. send) a cell must have received t=1 from all
         neighbours. However, while waiting for t=1 from one neighbour, it might also
	 receive t=2 from another neighbour, which it will need to repemeber for next
	 time. It is not possible to recieve anything with t=3, as no neighbour can get
	 there without receiving our t=2 (which we haven't sent yet).

         So at a given time t we need to deal with messages for both t=1 and t=2,
         and essentially need two copies. When we advance, the t+1 copy becomes
	 the t version and t+1 is empty.

		<Doc>
			A dirichlet variable provides a forcing value, so it
			is like an active source with some kind of feedback loop.
			
			The values forced in each time-step are determined by the
			current forcing segment. Each segment is a 2nd degree polynomial,
			given by three values: c0, c1 and c2
			
			At the start of a segment we set c0 to the constant coefficient:
			
			    v=c0
			
			At each following time-step it does the following:
			
			    v=v+c1
				c1=c1+c2;
				
			[st,et) - Time range of the segment
				The segment will not be started until st. It is valid to choose st=0, then the segment is always ready.
				The segment will not continue beyond et, blocking if necessary
			
			len - the length or period of the segment in updates
			
			endaction - what to do after len updates:
				
				0=Repeat : run the same segment again, unless a newer segment has been loaded
				
				1=Flip : at the end of the segment, negate c2
				
				2=Constant : Hold a constant value for the rest of the segment
				
			The complete segment is a tuple (st,et,len,endAction,c0,c1,c2)
			
			If a new segment is received where (st &lte; t) then it will immediately
			switch to that segment (this is the purpose of c0, so that we can jump
			to a value).
			
			Examples of segments:
			- (0,MAX_UINT,8,2, 5,0,0) - Immediately jump to value 5, and hold it
			- (100,1000,8,2, 5,0,0) - Immediately jump to value 5, and hold it
