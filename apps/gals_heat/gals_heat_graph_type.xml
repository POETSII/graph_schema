    <!-- Locally synchronous heat.
	 Each cell i has a time t, and all cells start at t=0.
	 Initially each cell knows its own state, but not its
	 neighbours, so all cells want to broadcast their state and move to t=1.
	 However, there is no ordering on the broadcasts, so the
	 order they achieve it in is going to be random.

         As the messages fly we have a number of situations:
         - t=0, no messages received    : wants to send t=0
	 - t=0, some messages received  : wants to send t=0
	 - t=0, all messages received   : wants to send t=1 (could also send t=2, but has to do t=1 first)
	 - t=1, no messaged received    : blocked
	 - t=1, some messages received  : blocked
	 - t=1, all messages recieved   : wants to send t=2

         In order to progress to t=2 (i.e. send) a cell must have received t=1 from all
         neighbours. However, while waiting for t=1 from one neighbour, it might also
	 receive t=2 from another neighbour, which it will need to repemeber for next
	 time. It is not possible to recieve anything with t=3, as no neighbour can get
	 there without receiving our t=2 (which we haven't sent yet).

         So at a given time t we need to deal with messages for both t=1 and t=2,
         and essentially need two copies. When we advance, the t+1 copy becomes
	 the t version and t+1 is empty.
