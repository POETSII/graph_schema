    <Documentation>
		This estimates betweenness centrality using parallel random walks.
        It is guaranteed terminating, but is not deterministic as the order
        of the walks depends on ordering of messages.

        Each device is a node in a graph (could be directed or not, doesn't matter),
        and has a set of outgoing edges, represented as indexed edges. In the first
        timestep each node originates a random walk, which it sends to one node
        chosen uniformly randomly amongst the targets. Within each timestep each
        node collects any arriving random walks by incrementing a counter. At the
        end of the timestep each node will have zero or more walks currently at that
        node. We then move to the next timestep, and each node fires out one walk
        for each walk terminating in the current timestep.

        The timesteps could be implemented using:
        1 - Standard GALS
        2 - Hardware step handler
        3 - An array of counters tracking how many walks are present at each timestep.
            Without some kind of global-virtual-time this will require a static maximum
            time step count.

        GALS would not make use of indexed sets, as it would require a send to every neighbour.

        Step handler would work well with indexed sends, though at the time of writing this
        isn't supported in graph_schema (adding indexed sends before step handler).

        So for now we take 3, as it is the most interesting, and might actually be fast.

        Because we expect some nodes to be more loaded, we allow for one message to represent
        more than one walk. Whether we exploit this or not I'm not sure yet, it would make
        sense with nodes that are extremely central, though such nodes might present
        a sequential bottleneck too.

        To handle termination we will use a collection node, which receives walks after
        they have reached the final time-step. It knows we have finished when as many
        walks have reached the end as there are nodes in the graph.

        In future this collection node should be an external, so as well as termination
        information we actually send up the node id and number of walks visited
        so far. That means that at the moment termination is detected the collection
        node also knows the number of walks passing through all nodes. Messages out
        to the collector could be re-ordered, but at the point of termination there
        will exist no messages still in flight.

        A tricky area is in how fast we let empty nodes run ahead. Once a node
        contains no walk it is able to race ahead through the array, and then notify
        the collector that it is idel. So in the worst case the nodes might
        spend a lot of time receiving a message, passing the walk on, and then immediately
        notifying the collector. If we're unlucky we could get an almost one-to-one
        correspondence between walk messages and notification message, or O(n*t). We solve this
        by only notifying the collector for completed nodes, which guarantees
        that the number of collection messages is O(n). That solves the message flood
        problem, but there is then a danger of the nodes running up and down the
        time-steps. A possible pattern is:
        - Node sends walk for time 1
        - Node is empty, so walks through array in O(t) time
        - Node receives walk for time 2
        - Node sends walk for time 2
        - Node is empty, so walks through array in O(t) time
        - ...
        If we're unlucky then we could incur O(t^2 n) compute cost,
        even though the number of messages sent is only O(t n).

        The correct solution to this is to do global virtual time management, which
        would require:
        - a node to count walks received in each time step
        - fan-in nodes to combine walks received in time steps, to avoid overload on master node
        - fan-out nodes to take GVT updates back out to the nodes
        It's not very complicated, but requires a lot of writing and testing, so
        for now I'm avoiding it.

        Another solution is to only allow the nodes to move through the timesteps once
        per send handler, and cancel if it is empty. Unfortunately, for the current
        softswitch designs the penalty in instructions would probably be worse the
        O(t) search through the array.

        So to "fix" this we'll just maintain hierarchical bit-masks, which indicate
        presence/absence. So the nodes will detect they are empty in O(log t) time,
        and also don't need to trash the cache when working out they are idle. We
        don't expect t to be very large, so if we pick a max of t=1023, then in
        we can cover all the bits using two levels of 32-bit masks
