    <Documentation>
    This is a simple example of a graph type with a single
    device type called "dev". The devices pass around a token.
    When a device receives a pulse it will broadcast it on
    to the connected device, which will then pass it on, and
    so on.

          Each device has:
          - a init input pin (called __init__)
          - one input pin called "in"
          - one output pin called "out"
          - a single boolean property called "leader"
          - a single boolean state variable called "hot"

          Graphically, the cell looks something like this:
          ````
                  type:"dev"
              +----------------+
              |   input:"in"   +->
              +----------------+
              |P  leader:int8_t|
              |S  hot:int8_t   |
              +----------------+
            ->|   output:"out" |
              +----------------+
          ````

          In terms of behaviour:
          - A cell is hot when hot==true, and cold when
            hot==false
          - A cell is intialised to hot if leader==true
          - When a cell is hot, it will send a message
            of type "transfer" on pin "out", then go
            cold.
          - When a cell receives a "transfer" message on
            "in", it will go hot.
          - The "out" pin is ready to send iff the cell
            is hot

          The state machine is then:
          ````
                __init__          +-----------+
                leader=1  .------>| hot=1     |
                        /         | rts={out} |
          +---------+  /          +---------+-+
          | startup +-'            ^        | send/out
          | hot=0   |              |        |
          | rts={}  +-.            |        |
          +---------+  \   recv/in |        v
                        \        +-+----------+
                __init__ '------>| hot=0      |
                leader=0         | rts={}     |
                                 +------------+
          ````
          (Notice that the __init__ message is not associated
          with the receipt of any data, so the only thing
          it can use is the graph and device properties.
          The init can be calculated ahead of time if desired,
          then the pre-initialised stateloaded instead)

          If no device instance is set up to be leader, the
          entire graph will remain quiescent forever.
