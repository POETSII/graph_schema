    This is a pair of cells called x and y. x is a leader, and will
    pass tokens on to y. y is a bit odd, and sends tokens both to
    itself and to x.

    When activated, device x will fire, which will make y hot
    (and x cold). But when y fires, it will pass the token
    both to itself and to x. Things now become non-deterministic,
    as we don't know what order the messages will be delivered
    to x and y.
