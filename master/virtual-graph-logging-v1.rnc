# The intent is that the event grammar captures sufficient detail
# that the entire execution graph can be recovered. Information
# is recorded in sufficient detail that the state of each device
# can be recovered before and after each event, though only the
# post-event state is recovered. Message sends and receives can
# be paired up, but the message is only included in the send side.
#
# Information that is available from the graph type or instance is not
# included, as it is assumed that it will be available by looking
# up the relevant id.
#
# Here begins the actual grammar itself
