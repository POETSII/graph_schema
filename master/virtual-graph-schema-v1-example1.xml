    This is a simple example of a graph type with a single
    device type called "dev". The devices pass around a token.
    When a device receives a pulse it will broadcast it on to
    the connected device, which will then pass it on, and so on.

         but you wouldn't want to accidentally connect an
         init port to a transfer port. -->

          Each device has:
          - a init input port (called __init__)
          - one input port called "in"
          - one output port called "out"
          - a single boolean property called "leader"
          - a single boolean state variable called "hot"
          
          Graphically, the cell looks something like this:
          ````        
                  type:"dev"             
              +----------------+
              |   input:"in"   +->
              +----------------+
              |P  leader:int8_t|
              |S  hot:int8_t   |
              +----------------+
            ->|   output:"out" |
              +----------------+
          ````

          In terms of behaviour:
          - A cell is hot when hot==true, and cold when hot==false
          - A cell is intialised to hot if leader==true
          - When a cell is hot, it will send a message of type "transfer" on port "out", then go cold.
          - When a cell receives a "transfer" message on "in", it will go hot.
          - The "out" port is ready to send iff the cell is hot
          
          The state machine is then:
          ````
                __init__          +-----------+
                leader=1  .------>| hot=1     |                                
                        /         | rts={out} |
          +---------+  /          +---------+-+
          | startup +-'            ^        | send/out
          | hot=0   |              |        |
          | rts={}  +-.            |        |
          +---------+  \   recv/in |        v
                        \        +-+----------+
                __init__ '------>| hot=0      |
                leader=0         | rts={}     |
                                 +------------+
          ````
          (Notice that the __init__ message is not associated with the
          receipt of any data, so the only thing it can use is the
          graph and device properties. The init can be calculated
          ahead of time if desired, then the pre-initialised state
          loaded instead)
          
          If no device instance is set up to be leader, the entire graph
          will remain quiescent forever.
