#
#
# This file is a <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> schema
# for defining POETS graph types and instances. This document
# is both the grammar specification, and the documentation of
# that specification.
#
# A RELAX NG grammar uses a BNF like description to constrain
# an XML document to particular patterns, allowing you to specify
# what kinds of elements and attributes can appear within each
# other, and how many of each are allowed/needed. It is
# essentially the same as using a YACC grammar, except
# no code generation is needed. There are existing tools for
# working with these grammers, which are able to take an
# XML document and check that it matches the grammar.
#
# ### Changes from version 0
#
# There are a few changes/additions since v0:
# - Edge properties and state are now defined on the input pin rather
#   than the edge itself. This is based on looking at how Spinnaker
#   does things, and some situations where some device types need
#   different properties for input pins with the same device type.
#
# ### Changes from version 1
#
# Everything that was once a "port" is now a "pin".
#
# All XML files should have a Provenance element. This is still only loosely specified though,
# and needs to be refined.
#
# ### Changes from 2 -> 2.1
#
# PIP-0007 integrated
#
# ### Changes from 2.1 -> 2.2
#
# PIP-0004 integrated

# BEGIN_SCHEMA

# This section establishes some ambient declarations
# for the grammar
#
# This is used to bring in things like integers, as XML
# Schema doesn't support many primitive types.
datatypes xsd = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-datatypes"

# This is the XML namespace within which the graphs live.
# If a breaking change is made to the graph specification,
# then the namespace identifier will change.
default namespace = "https://poets-project.org/schemas/virtual-graph-schema-v2"


# Here begins the actual grammar itself
grammar {

  ## All identifiers used in the graph types are simplified C
  ## identifiers. This applies to type ids and instances ids.
  identifier = xsd:string { pattern = "[a-zA-Z0-9_]+" }

  ## Source code that appears within the handlers should be
  ## non-allocating C++ with no IO. i.e. it can contain anything
  ## that does not require dynamic memory allocation and does not
  ## cause input-output.
  ##
  ## Using the C++ run-time library is allowed as long as:
  ## - The function does not allocate memory or perform IO
  ## - It does not rely on global state
  ## - It does not interact with the environment/platform/OS
  ## - It expands inline into primitive C
  ## So things like `std::copy` will be ok, but `std::cout` or
  ## `exit` are not.

  cxxSourceCode = text

  ## This is used to attach documentation strings to graph types.
  ## We allow effectively anything to appear within Documentation elements,
  ## and so rely on a helper rule called "anything"

  documentation = anything

  ## A definition of "anything" used by documentation, which can be:
  ## - Any type of element (element *), which can contain anyhing
  ## - Any attribute, with any content type
  ## - Any text element

  anything = element * { anything } * & attribute * { text } * & text *

  ## The top-level element is a container for POETS graphs and instances

  start =

    ## The top-level container can contain any number of graph types,
    ## instances, or snapshorts. These can be arbitrarily interleaved,
    ## though typically you would expect to see either:
    ## - A single graph type
    ## - A graph type followed by an instance of that type
    ##
    ## Any graph instance must refer to a graph type that has already
    ## been defined using a GraphType, or declared using a GraphTypeReference.
    ##
    ## An example of a top-level graph, including xml pre-amble, would be:
    ##
    ##    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    ##    <Graphs xmlns="https://poets-project.org/schemas/virtual-graph-schema-v2">
    ##      <GraphType id="my_graph_type">

    ##      <GraphInstances id="my_graph_instance" graphTypeId="my_graph_type">
    ##         ... <!-- See GraphInstance -->
    ##      </GraphInstances>
    ##    </Graphs>

    element Graphs {

      ## If non-breaking changes are made to the schema, the minor
      ## version can be increased. The major version is explicit
      ## in the namespace for the schema.

        ## A device type captures a piece of structure and functionality that can
        ## be instantiated within the graph. All devices of the same type are identical
        ## except for the functionality they have.
        ##
        ## The number of pins must be fixed, but we allow a variable number of
        ## edges to enter or leave a pin. Alongside the edge properties and
        ## edge state this provides storage that scales with the number of edges.
        ##
        ## Application pins are pins that are implicitly connected to the application,
        ## so sending on an application output pin will send the message to
        ## to the application, while application input pins will only receive messages
        ## from the application. It is illegal to connect an application pin to
        ## an edge instance, for both input and output application pins.
        ##
        ## Messages are delivered to the device in any order, and a device has no
        ## way of avoiding receipt of messages.
        ##
        ## Priorities
        ##
        ## Each output pin and the compute pin of the device are given a unique
        ## non-negative `requestIndex`. The requestIndex will be contiguous and start at zero.
        ## so they can be used as bit-field masks. The maximum number of output pins + compute
        ## pin is fixed at 32, in order to bound memory requirements at one word per device.
        ##
        ## For an output pin called {name}, the requestIndex will be available within
        ## handlers and device shared code as `RTS_INDEX_{name}`, and the
        ## equivalent bit-mask as `RTS_FLAG_{name}`. The compute handler
        ## (if there is one) will have an equivalent `RTC_INDEX` and
        ## `RTC_FLAG`. These values will be injected as C++ identifiers
        ## when the handler code is compiled, so for different devices there will be
        ## different identifiers in scope.
        ##
        ## The index of a pin determines its priority, with the lowest value having
        ## the highest priority. By default the priorities will be assigned in the
        ## order that outputs appear in the device type, with the compute handler
        ## always receiving lowest priority (highest index). The priorities can be
        ## modified for each output by using the `priority` attribute on OutputPin
        ## and OnCompute. This means it is possible to specifiy that the compute pin
        ## has a higher priority than an output pin, which might make sense if
        ## we had a very low priority output (for example a heart-beat).
        ##
        ## Priorities are statically assigned, and are hints, so they do not have to be
        ## observed at run-time. A natural example is that the compute
        ## handler typically has the lowest priority, but it will run
        ## ahead of the other handlers if there is no space available.
        ## Another example is where the high priority pin sends to a
        ## remote device, but the low priority only sends to a local device
        ## Network congestion may block the remote send, but it may be
        ## possible to send then immediately deliver the local message.

  #
  # Typed Data Specifications
  # =========================
  #
  # It represents the prototype for a typed piece of data, along with
  # the default values. The intent is that typed data is used for
  # everything managed by P-Cores and send over the P-Core network,
  # so typed data is explicitly fixed-size. It also needs to be
  # writeable and readable by high-level tools, so the structure
  # needs to be explicitly defined - we can't just use raw bytes
  # everywhere.
  #
  # Typed-data is intended to be binary compatible across all native
  # platforms, requiring zero marshalling. But we also need simulation
  # platforms to be able to bring that raw binary data into their world
  # (e.g. for Python, Haskell, JavaScript). In order to ensure this, we have
  # to think about:
  # - Cross compiler compatibility, making sure that all the platforms
  #   end up with exactly the same layout.
  # - Alignment requirements on certain platforms. x86-64, ARM, and RISC-V all
  #   support unaligned reads, but if we want to do MIPS/NIOS/MBlaze then
  #   they are more complicated. The compiler can sort it out, but it will
  #   be slower.
  # - Performance versus padding. If we pad out to give performance for
  #   the x64-64, it is likely to just be wasting space (memory and cache)
  #   on the RISC-V.
  # - Bit-wise packing. We are likely to really care about bit-field packing
  #   for some messages and data structures.
  #
  # One possibility would be to use ASN.1 to define the structures,
  # as this is a well-established method for describing data-structures,
  # allowing fine-grain control over formatting. However it is mainly
  # designed for messages on the wire, rather than data-structures
  # that are manipulated directly (although it can be used for either).
  # It also adds another tool-chain, and manipulating ASN.1 requires
  # toolchains and libraries that aren't available in all platforms - there
  # are JavaScript ASN.1 libraries around, but they didn't look that
  # robust. Haskell and Python have good libraries though.
  #
  # We could also embed the C declaration directly in this file,
  # then rely on the consumer to parse it out. The obvious down-side
  # is that every platform/language then needs a C structure parser,
  # and we would have to create some method of explicitly specifying
  # packing (though `#pragma pack(1)` is pretty portable).
  # The layout of bit-fields is also [implementation defined](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/bit_field),
  # so we really can't rely on the compilers for all the different
  # CPUs and OSs doing the same thing.
  #
  # The approach taken here is to describe C structures directly
  # as part of the DOM, as everyone already has an XML parser. The
  # conversion process to a C struct or binary format is then
  # mandated by this specification.
  #
  # In order to eliminate surprises, the approach taken is that
  # the ordering given by the designer mandates the layout in
  # memory. This means that the designer has to take complete
  # responsibility for getting good packing, but they can also
  # do weird pointer-tricks if they really want to.
  #
  # For bit-fields, we want to allow them, but don't want
  # complicated padding/alignment. I (DBT) cannot see a portable
  # way of defining bit-fields that will end up the same
  # on all architectures - these things aren't even defined by the
  # compiler, it's [down to the ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit-fields-implementation.html).
  # The only way I could see to support this is to indicate that
  # a scalar integer is actually split into bit-fields, but not
  # to try to express them as C bit-fields. That way we would get complete
  # control over the layout, and high-level tools can still
  # extract the fields. The downside is that the bit-fields have
  # to have associated accessor functions to get and set the values.
  #
  # So for now, bit-fields are not supported.
  #
  # We support unions, as space is important for both messages and
  # storage, but must also have the ability to interpret a structure
  # at run-time (e.g. for debuggers and visualisation). So unions
  # are tagged unions, with the tag value representing which of the
  # alternatives is active.
  #
  # So the rules are:
  # - Every type has a size in bytes
  # - The size of an integer or float is its natural size (e.g. uint32_t is 4, half is 2, uint64_t is 8)
  # - All data-structures are laid out in the order specified in the type specification
  # - The size of a tuple is the sum of the size of the elements, laid out end to end
  # - The size of an array is the size of the element multiplied by the array length
  # - The size of a union is the maximum size of any alternative plus 1 for the tag byte
  #   - The tag byte is the last byte in the layout, appearing after the biggest alternative.
  #     It is last because that is least likely to cause performance problems, as you can
  #     pad up after the tag byte to get a decent alignment
  #
  # There is no boolean type, because it does not have a natural platform-portable
  # size. It is suggested to use an `int8_t` for performance, or a bit-field for size.
  
  # We now support arbitrary ids due to TypeDef

  ## Typed data is encoded in plain text rather than XML.
  ## - The encoding is simply "name":value, with name-value pairs seperated by commas.
  ## - Tuples are encoded as `"name":{ "sub-name":value, ... }`
  ## - Arrays are encoded as `"name":[value,value,...]`
  ## - Unions are encoded as `"union.tag" : value`, where "union" is the name of the union, and
  ##   "tag" is the name of the currently active union member.
  ##
  ## Any relationship to JSON is entirely intentional. I realise there is an irony
  ## in using XML on the outside and JSON on the inside. There are a few reasons for this:
  ## - global scale data-structures are much more difficult to debug if there are unbalanced
  ##   closing tags, but at a local level it is not much of a problem.
  ## - If the detailed structures are also XML, then we have to take the cost of parsing
  ##   all the details in order to get the overall structures and ids. Embedding them as strings
  ##   means that the XML parser can skip over them.
  ## - Similarly, it supports more parallelism in the reading processes, as the work of
  ##   parsing the details gets moved out of the bottleneck process of parsing the XML,
  ##   and can be moved into the (parallel) building of the graph.
  ##
  ## The only difference with JSON is that there is an implicit surrounding
  ## pair of curly brackets. So given a string `typedDataValue`, you can turn
  ## it into parseable JSON as `"{"+typedDataValue+"}"`.
  typedDataValue =
    text

  ## This is a bundle of arbitrary JSON encoded properties, using the same
  ## implicit surrounding brackets as typedDataValue. This is distinct from
  ## typedDataValue because it is free-form, so grammatically it is a different
  ## kind of thing. The actual semantics and namespace of the values is
  ## not determined here, except for some "well-known" values:
  ##
  ## - "nativeDimension":number - Attached to graphs to indicate what the diesion
