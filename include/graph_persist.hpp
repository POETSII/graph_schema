/*!
  Metadata is represented as rapidjson structs, as they
  are pretty good for memory efficiency, and can handle
  untyped bags of stuff. The semantics are always move
  semantics, as this makes it easier to pass through data.
  Most of the time you won't know what the metadata means,
  so you grab hold of it when you are given it, add or read
  anything you know about, then pass it on to the destination.
